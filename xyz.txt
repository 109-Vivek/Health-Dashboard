1. **Influenza and Pain Management:**
   Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is an infectious respiratory illness. Symptoms include fever, cough, and body aches. The recommended treatment involves pain management, including over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to alleviate discomfort and reduce fever.

2. **Hypertension (High Blood Pressure) and Lisinopril:**
   High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a condition that often shows no symptoms. However, if left untreated, it can lead to serious health issues. Lisinopril is a common medication used to control blood pressure, preventing complications associated with hypertension.

3. **Type 2 Diabetes and Metformin:**
   Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and high blood sugar levels. Metformin is a widely prescribed medication that helps manage blood glucose levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity.

4. **Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever) and Antihistamines:**
   Allergic rhinitis, commonly known as hay fever, manifests with symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes. Antihistamines, such as loratadine, can effectively relieve these symptoms by blocking the action of histamines released during an allergic reaction.

5. **Gastroenteritis and Clear Liquid Diet:**
   Gastroenteritis, often caused by viral or bacterial infections, leads to symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting. Treatment involves a clear liquid diet to stay hydrated and provide essential nutrients while the digestive system recovers.

6. **Migraine and Triptans:**
   Migraines cause severe headaches, nausea, and sensitivity to light. Triptans, such as sumatriptan, are a class of medications specifically designed to relieve migraine symptoms by narrowing blood vessels and reducing pain.

7. **Pneumonia and Antibiotics:**
   Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition affecting the lungs, often caused by infection. In bacterial pneumonia cases, antibiotics like azithromycin or amoxicillin are prescribed to target and eliminate the infectious bacteria.

8. **Asthma and Inhaled Corticosteroids:**
   Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by wheezing and difficulty breathing. Inhaled corticosteroids, such as fluticasone, help manage inflammation in the airways, providing relief for individuals with asthma.

9. **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) and Antibiotics:**
   UTIs result in painful urination and lower abdominal discomfort. Antibiotics like ciprofloxacin are commonly prescribed to eliminate the bacteria causing the infection and alleviate symptoms.

10. **Osteoarthritis and Joint Pain Management:**
    Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease leading to joint pain and stiffness. Management often involves pain relief medications, physical therapy, and lifestyle adaptations to improve joint function.

11. **Hypothyroidism and Levothyroxine:**
    Hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone, is treated with medications like levothyroxine. This hormone replacement therapy helps regulate metabolism and alleviate symptoms like fatigue and weight gain.

12. **Rheumatoid Arthritis and Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs):**
    Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder causing joint inflammation. DMARDs, such as methotrexate, are prescribed to slow down the progression of the disease and manage symptoms.

13. **Common Cold and Over-the-Counter Cold Medications:**
    The common cold is a viral infection with symptoms like runny nose and sore throat. Over-the-counter cold medications, including decongestants and cough suppressants, can help alleviate symptoms and improve comfort.

14. **Malaria and Antimalarial Drugs:**
    Malaria, a mosquito-borne infectious disease, is treated with antimalarial drugs like chloroquine. These medications target the malaria parasite in the bloodstream and prevent the progression of the disease.

15. **Lung Cancer and Chemotherapy:**
    Lung cancer, a malignant tumor in the lungs, often requires a multidisciplinary approach for treatment. Chemotherapy, a systemic treatment targeting rapidly dividing cells, is commonly employed to shrink or eliminate cancerous cells.
